\title{inspect the mip problem formulation for one record}
\usage{
inspect_mip_adjust(data, x, weight, ...)
}
\description{
Utility function to inspect the mip problem for a record.
}
\details{
It may sometimes be handy to find out what is happening exactly with a record.
See the example section for finding out what to do with inspect_mip.
}
\examples{
rules <- validator(x > 1)
data <- list(x = 0)
weight <- c(x = 1)

mip <- inspect_mip(data, rules)
print(mip)

# inspect the lp problem (prior to solving it with lpsolveAPI)
lp <- mip$to_lp()
print(lp)

# for large problems write the lp problem to disk for inspection
# lpSolveAPI::write.lp(lp, "my_problem.lp")

# solve the mip system / find a solution
res <- mip$execute()
names(res)

# lpSolveAPI status of finding a solution
res$s

# lp problem after solving (often simplified version of first lp)
res$lp

# records that are deemed "faulty"
res$errors

# values of variables used in the mip formulation. Also contains a valid solution
# for "faulty" variables
res$values

# see the derived mip rules and objective function, used in the construction of
# lp problem
